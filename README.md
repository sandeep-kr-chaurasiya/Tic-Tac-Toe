# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns playing Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

- **Game Status**: Display the current winner or if the game is a draw.
